## Overview

The overview of the backend is pretty simple. It's goal is to store notes which are of the following structure:

**Entity: `Note`**

| Field     | Type      | Required | Description                |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| id        | string    | Yes      | Unique identifier          |
| title     | string    | Yes      | Short title of the note    |
| content   | string    | Yes      | Main note body             |
| createdAt | timestamp | Yes      | Time note was created      |
| updatedAt | timestamp | Yes      | Time note was last updated |

---

## Features

- CRUD Operation of Notes
One can create, read, update and delete notes from the database

- Firebase Firestore Integration
The database used is Firebase Firestore

- Request and Error Logging
Requests and errors are logged with timestamps in respective .log files

---

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Firebase (Firestore)
- Vercel (serverless deployment)
- Other libraries/tools as needed

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone "https://github.com/BrianKamauKahara/SimpleProjectBackend"

# Navigate to project
cd <project-folder>

# Install dependencies
npm install

```

## Environment Variables

You will only need your own firebase credentials as the environment variable.
To accomplish this, follow the steps below:
1. Go to the [firebase website](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) and create your own firestore project
2. Download your credentials JSON file
3. Stringify the credential file using JSON.stringify and store the result in the .env

```bash
FIREBASE_CRED=<parsed_json_credential>
```

---

## Usage

This is how you will run the project locally

```bash
# Run server locally
npm start

# Or with hot reload
npx run dev

```


## API Endpoints

| Method | Route        | Description         | Body / Params       |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| GET    | /notes      | Fetch all notes    | None             |
| POST   | /notes      | Create a new note  | { title, content } |
| GET    | /notes/:id  | Get a note by ID   | id               |
| PUT    | /notes/:id  | Update note by ID  | id + body        |
| DELETE | /notes/:id  | Delete note by ID  | id               |


## Middleware

- **Database Connector (dbConn.js)**: ensures Firestore is connected  
- **EventLogger**: logs all incoming requests  
- **ErrorLogger**: catches and responds with structured error messages


## Error Handling

Errors from the bad requests, invalid requests, internal and other are formatted as follows:

```json
"error": {
  "code": "error code e.g not-found, bad-request, interal, 5, etc, according to firestore",
  "message": "description of error",
  "other": "there are other fields which depend on the error type e.g errors"
}

```

The following HTTP status codes are used

```json 
const errorCodes = {
  'not-found': 404,
  5: 404, // gRPC fallback
  'already-exists': 409,
  6: 409,
  'permission-denied': 403,
  7: 403,
  'unavailable': 500,
  14: 500,
  'bad-request' : 400
}
```

## Deployment

If you wish to also deploy on vercel, I would recommend:

1. Push repo to GitHub  
2. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel  
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard  
4. Deploy → check serverless logs for any issues

I have worked to fix the issues that happen during deployment. If you face any feel free to contact me
