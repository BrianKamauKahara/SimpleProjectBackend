# Student Notes Manager

_A Full-Stack CRUD Web Application_

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Students frequently store notes across multiple platforms, leading to disorganization and data loss.  
The goal of this project is to design and implement a **full-stack web application** that allows a user to **create, read, update, and delete notes** through a React frontend and a Node.js backend using a RESTful API.

The system must clearly separate frontend and backend concerns while maintaining consistent data flow and reliability.

---

## 2. System Overview

- **Frontend:** React (SPA)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** SQLite or MongoDB
- **Architecture:** Client–Server (REST)

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Data Model

**Entity: `Note`**

| Field     | Type      | Required | Description                |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| id        | string    | Yes      | Unique identifier          |
| title     | string    | Yes      | Short title of the note    |
| content   | string    | Yes      | Main note body             |
| createdAt | timestamp | Yes      | Time note was created      |
| updatedAt | timestamp | Yes      | Time note was last updated |

> Thought: Why should timestamps be generated by the backend?

---

### 3.2 Backend Requirements (Node + Express)

#### API Endpoints (CRUD)

| Method | Endpoint     | Description              |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| POST   | `/notes`     | Create a new note        |
| GET    | `/notes`     | Retrieve all notes       |
| GET    | `/notes/:id` | Retrieve a specific note |
| PUT    | `/notes/:id` | Update an existing note  |
| DELETE | `/notes/:id` | Delete a note            |

#### Behavioral Rules

- Use JSON for all requests and responses
- Validate incoming data
- Return proper HTTP status codes
- Handle missing or invalid resources gracefully

> Thought: What distinguishes a `400` error from a `404`?

---

### 3.3 Frontend Requirements (React)

#### Core Features

- Display all notes
- Create a new note via a form
- Edit an existing note
- Delete a note
- Show loading and error states

#### UI Constraints

- Single Page Application (no reloads)
- Controlled form components
- Clear component separation

> Thought: Which state should be fetched vs derived?

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- Code must be modular and readable
- Backend and frontend must be independently runnable
- Environment variables for configuration
- Persistent storage across refreshes

---

## 5. Assumptions & Constraints

- Single-user system
- No authentication or authorization
- No collaboration features
- Focus on correctness over UI design

> Thought: Which assumption limits scalability the most?

---

## 6. Success Criteria

- All CRUD operations function end-to-end
- Data persists after refresh
- API is testable independently
- UI remains stable under failure conditions
